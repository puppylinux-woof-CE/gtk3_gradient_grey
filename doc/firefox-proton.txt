To enable CSS fixes in Firefox with the Proton UI, create a new directory
called ‘chrome’ in your Firefox profile directory and copy the files from
the ‘src/firefox-proton’ into it.

Once copied, you need to enable the stylesheet in your preferences:

  toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets = true

After that, Firefox requires restart to reload the styles.
